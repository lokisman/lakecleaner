Design of a Lake-cleaning Bot
its open solidorks 2016
## Aim of project -
         The main aim of the project is to clean the polluting water bodies with the help of a cleaning bot which is controlled wirelessly           and further can be made autonomous.
          The bot has to perform the functions of collecting the solid trash present in the water bodies like plastic bags,plastic                   bottles,small objects,etcâ€¦ Further it should also be able to cut the small plants and weeds growing on the water surface and             also collect them in the trash pit. After this process, it should empty this trash into a disposable pit.
## Working principle-
          different mechanism have different-different like as_
    # conveyar mechanism- this mechanism use for transfer waste,garbage from water body to dump box. The conveyer belt is mounted at an                             inclination to the chassis. As the cylinders over which the conveyer belt slides roll, the belt moves in the                             anti- clockwise direction so that the solid waste gets stuck in the projections made in the conveyer belt. 
    #Dumper Lifting Mechanism-
                             it is use to lifting the box , In this lead screw mechanism use ,its give us linear motion.in this lead                                     screw is mount on coupler.lead screw mount with motor shaft when motor shaft is move in amti clockwise                                   due to linear motion dump box is move upward.
                             
 ##Different Parts-
          #Chasis-       The chassis is designed so as to accommodate the wheels mountings, conveyer belt mechanism mounting, four link                            mechanism mounting and finally the chassis should sustain the weight of the (garbage + self-weight).
